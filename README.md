Verify:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

#### üêß Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y nodejs npm
```

> If your distro provides an outdated Node version, consider using NodeSource or nvm:
>
> NodeSource example (replace `18.x` with desired major version):
>
> ```bash
> curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
> sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
> ```
>
> Or install nvm (Node Version Manager) and then install Node via nvm:
>
> ```bash
> curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.4/install.sh | bash
> # then restart shell and:
> nvm install --lts
> ```

### 3. Install Ionic and Angular CLIs

Once Node.js and npm are ready, install the global CLIs:

```bash
npm install -g @ionic/cli @angular/cli
```

Verify:

```bash
ionic --version
ng version
```

---

### 4. Install Project Dependencies

From the project root (where `package.json` is located):

```bash
npm install
```

> If you use yarn, you can run:
>
> ```bash
> yarn
> ```

---

### 5. Run the Application (development server)

To start the app in the browser with live reload:

```bash
ionic serve
```

This typically opens the app at: http://localhost:8100

If the browser doesn't open automatically, visit that URL manually.

## üì± Running on Mobile Devices

### ü§ñ Android

1. Install Android Studio and set up SDK & emulator or connect a physical device.  
   - Ensure `ANDROID_HOME` / `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` environment variables are set if needed.  
   - Enable USB debugging on a physical device.

2. Build & run with Capacitor:

```bash
# build the web assets first
ionic build

# copy to the native Android project
npx cap sync android

# open Android Studio (or run directly)
npx cap open android
```

From Android Studio you can run on an emulator or device. Or run directly:

```bash
ionic capacitor run android -l --external
```

> Use `-l --external` for livereload if the device and host are on the same network.

---

### üçè iOS (macOS only)

1. Install Xcode from the App Store and accept licenses.  
2. Build & sync:

```bash
ionic build
npx cap sync ios
npx cap open ios
```

Open the Xcode workspace and run on a simulator or device. Code signing is required for running on a real device.
